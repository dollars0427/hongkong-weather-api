# HKO Weather API

## What is this?

HKO Weather API is a wrapper of [node-hongkong-weather](https://github.com/hongkongkiwi/node-hongkong-weather/blob/master/README.md), which for people get Hong Kong Weather easily.

Node Hong Kong Weather is a non-completed project, so currently it only can get current weather data.
Maybe I will help it implement more function

## Requirement

Node.js Version >= 8.0.0

## Usage

```bash
npm install
node main.js
```

then the server will start on 8000 port.
